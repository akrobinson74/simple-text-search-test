The guide communicated very little during our wait and only when asked advised that we would set off a little late because company policy was to wait for all guests. On getting to the entrance to the museum the guide asked us all to enter and then when she had counted us all in (well not quite all as three went missing at this stage), she advised that children and students needed to go with her to validate their age. But on return, she started reading out each name and then hand out each ticket. More time spent on it.\nSo at 09.15, three guests missing and at least 15 guest remaining I asked if we could just have our tickets.

This can take an hour or so depending on the amount of people as there are quite a few corridors to walk through.\n\nIn the Sistine Chapel (basically a large hall) you are asked to be quiet and to not take any photos of the famous paintings.
