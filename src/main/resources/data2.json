The guide communicated very little during our wait and only when asked advised that we would set off a little late because company policy was to wait for all guests. On getting to the entrance to the museum the guide asked us all to enter and then when she had counted us all in (well not quite all as three went missing at this stage), she advised that children and students needed to go with her to validate their age. But on return, she started reading out each name and then hand out each ticket. More time spent on it.\nSo at 09.15, three guests missing and at least 15 guest remaining I asked if we could just have our tickets.

Vi skulle m\u00f8de en guide kl. 10. Her gik det fint med en kort instruks, for derefter at hente en audio guide. Det var en god m\u00e5de at f\u00e5 de udstillede fund og kunstv\u00e6rkers historie p\u00e5. Jeg kunne fordybe mig p\u00e5 trods af den i\u00f8vrigt alt for store m\u00e6ngde af turister. Hele Roms historie var pr\u00e6senteret p\u00e5 en sp\u00e6ndende og oplysende m\u00e5de-Den lange gang med bl.a. kort over Italien var sjov og interessant. Jeg er glad for at have set Rafael og Michelangelo\u00b4s v\u00e6rker. I det Sixtinske kapel var det ubehageligt at h\u00f8re en h\u00e5rd mandsstemme hele tiden r\u00e5be om stilhed og ingen fotos. Det kunne nok g\u00f8res mere n\u00e6nsomt - det forstyrrede i h\u00f8j grad den fordybelse, indlevelse, andagt og h\u00f8jtidelighed stedet kr\u00e6vede. Vi brugte ihvertfald fire timer p\u00e5 bes\u00f8get - Tog inden afslutningen lidt spiseligt i stedets restaurant. Det kan klart anbefales at bruge \u0026quot;GetYourGuide\u0026quot; for s\u00e5 at undg\u00e5 en timelang ventetid i k\u00f8.
